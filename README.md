This is a [Node.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created with supporting usage of Express, <b>[Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/docs/)</b> and Mongoose to handle front end and Data storage. Currently all the links to MongoDB based Database is removed and thus the template does not store Data.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This will launch the local environment for your system and will create a local result at local host 5000. To see the result:

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.
